Rust bindings for [LMDB](http://symas.com/mdb/)

Basic functionality like creating/opening environment and use
transactions, cursors works.

Building
========

LMDB is bundled as submodule so update submodules first:

`git submodule update --init`

And then

`cargo build`

Feel free to ping me if you have a question or a suggestion how to
make it better and idiomatic.
