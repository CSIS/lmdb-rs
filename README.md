lmdb-rs
=======

Rust bindings for [LMDB](http://symas.com/mdb/)

Basic functionality like creating/opening environment and use
transactions, cursors works.

[Documentation](http://www.rust-ci.org/vhbit/lmdb-rs/doc/lmdb/)
has no samples, but test case have.

Feel free to ping me if you have a question or a suggestion how to
make it better (more rusty way).
