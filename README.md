lmdb-rs
==========

Rust bindings for [LMDB](http://symas.com/mdb/)

Basic functionality like creating/opening environment and use
transactions, cursors works.

Not much documentation and samples yet although tests might give
pretty decent understanding on how it works.

Feel free to ping me if you have a question or a suggestion how to
make it better (rusty way).
